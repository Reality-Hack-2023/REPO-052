Have you ever tried speaking a new language? It’s hard right? To make it worse, there’s few opportunities to practice. You need to find a fluent speaker to practice with or spend a lot of money to hire a tutor. We want to empower everyone to practice speaking for free.

We are a language learning community to help you practice speaking in a new language with other people in virtual worlds. We created a credit system, called TBucks, to make this ecosystem work: You can help others practice speaking in your native tongue to gain TBucks. And then spend TBucks to practice in a new language you want to learn.
